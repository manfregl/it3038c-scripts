For my project, I made a python calculator with the help of https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-make-a-calculator-program-in-python-3. This site was able to help me code the basic math operations and the website was created by: Digital Ocean and this specific code was written by Lisa Tagliaferri. This basic python calculator can compute up to 5 numbers for addition and substraction and only 2 numbers for multiplcation and division. When you first run the code it will ask what operation you would like to run, if you choose addition or subtraction you can enter 5 numbers but if you need less just enter a 0. If you choose multplication or divsion just enter the first 2 numbers you need and any other number for 3-5. It will only compute the first 2 numbers. After the calculation is done, it will give the option to run it again. If you decide not to run again it will say goodbye!
