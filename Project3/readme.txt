For project3 I really wanted to work with the flask app and build upon what we created in the bonus lab. I made the website describe details about me inclduing where I live, my facortie sport teams, the world cup, and my current progress within UC. There are some embedded links to learm more about some of the stuff I included in the website.

In order to start the site we need to activate venv for linux. then run the command web.py so that it starts the site on the IP address of the linux box and on port 5000

Firsst enter your name and then click on the tabs to see about me!
